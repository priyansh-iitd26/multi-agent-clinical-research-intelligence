# this file defines tools that let agents fetch live data directly
# from the ClinicalTrials.gov API during an analysis run

# wait, didn't we already download study data during ingestion ?
# yes - and that data lives in our Cloud SQL database
# so, why do we need these tools?

# three reasons :

# 1. freshness -> ClinicalTrials.gov updates constantly
# a study that showed "results_posted: False" during ingestion
# might have posted results since then 
# these tools fetch the current state of data directly from the source

# 2. detail -> our ingestion pipeline stores a subset of fields
# the full ClinicalTrials.gov API response has hundreds of fields
# when an agent needs a very specific field we did not store
# (like a specific amendment date or trial arm detail),
# these tools fetch it directly
#
# 3. discovery -> agents may encounter NCT IDs during analysis
# that were never in our original ingestion corpus
# these tools let agents fetch any study on demand

# IMPORTANT - these tools make live API calls :
# unlike search_tools.py which only queries our local database,
# these tools hit the real ClinicalTrials.gov API over the internet
# they add network latency to agent runs (~1-2 seconds per call)
# agents should use database tools first and only call these
# when they specifically need live or detailed data

# we create a fresh client inside each tool call instead
# this is slightly less efficient but much safer - the client
# opens and closes its HTTP connection cleanly for each call
